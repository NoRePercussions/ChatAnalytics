Messenger Test Case Setup
=========================

Alphanumerical IDs
-------------
- All IDs used should be completely or partially randomly
  generated by ``gen_messenger_id`` in ``utils_for_test_cases.py`` in
  the ``test`` directory, or by a similar generator
- Messenger IDs are 10 digits by default – use 8 digit IDs
  in test data

Timestamps
----------
- Timestamps should be in milliseconds since the epoch
- Timestamps should be randomly or manually selected to 
  match test cases rather than using existing timestamps
  
Chat Types
===============
Test cases should be a mix of types:

- ``Regular`` is a direct message – eg in ``directmessage_78o3u1q7``
- ``RegularGroup`` is a group message – eg in ``groupmessage_99hdkg23``
