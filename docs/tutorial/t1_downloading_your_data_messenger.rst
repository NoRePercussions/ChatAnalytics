1. First open `Facebook.com <facebook.com>`_ in a new tab and
sign into your account.

2. Click the dropdown arrow |dropdown inline| in the top right and select **Settings
and Privacy**, then **Settings**.

3. In the left sidebar, select **Your Facebook Information**,
then **Download Your Information** in the middle of the page.

4. Change the **Format** dropdown to JSON. It is recommended that
you change **Media Quality** to Low - Facebook will process
your request significantly faster, and the download will be
smaller. Select any date range you desire.

5. At the top of the **Select information to download** pane, click
"Deselect All" to toggle off every entry. Scroll down and toggle
"Messages" (near the top) back on.

6. Click **Request a Download** at the bottom and Facebook
will prepare your data and notify you when it is ready.
With the suggested settings, it takes 5-10 minutes for my data.
